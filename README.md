## Time-Series Analysis
 Stock Analysis - Patrick Lowe
 In this assignment I will be looking at 3 stock markets; Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Electronic Arts (EA), and Nintendo(NTDOY). I have a personal interest in these games but felt that choosing 3 from similair industries will allow for better insight into trends such as large declines or inclines. I may also use the odd 4th stock market as trend comparison to see if the trend is industry specific. Using various charts I will try to create the following:
 - Display stock on daily, monthly, and annual frequences
 - Identify trends by company/industry
 - Identify if day of the week influences investment
 
 These datasets can be viewed here:

## World Bank Development Indicators
 In this assignment I will be looking at the World Bank Development Indicators data. Since this is a large dataset with a variety of insights available, I have chosen to narrow it down by asking 5 questions from different categories (i.e. not all relating to population orientated questions). This is so that there is a varied insight into each country, as some may perform better in different sections. To begin, the data will be loaded into a dataframe as a whole, then narrowed down by country into their own Dataframe. From these, I will filter out 'Indicators' that I find interesting to analyize. The dataframe will then be transposed so that it is more easily ready. Using various charts I will try to analyize the following topics:
 - How do gas emissions vary from country to country?
 - What has the population growth been like?
 - Do countries which contribute a higher percentage of their GDP towards education result in a better educated population?
 - How do imports/exports affect a country and what may cause these trends?
